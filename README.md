# Operating Systems Projects

This repository features five projects, each emphasizing different aspects of operating systems:

## 1. Mini-Libc
A lightweight implementation of the standard C library, focusing on essential functions to enhance understanding of system calls and memory management.

## 2. Memory Allocator
A project that simulates memory allocation functions (`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`) using system calls, emphasizing memory management techniques.

## 3. Parallel Graph
This project explores parallel processing by implementing algorithms to traverse graphs concurrently, showcasing the efficiency of multi-threading.

## 4. Mini-Shell
A simple command-line shell that interprets and executes user commands, providing insights into process management and inter-process communication.

## 5. Async Web Server
An asynchronous web server implementation that handles multiple client requests concurrently, demonstrating the use of non-blocking I/O and event-driven programming.

For more details on each project, please refer to their respective README files.
